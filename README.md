## Haven Full-Stack Engineering Applicant Exercise

## The Mini Project
**You can use this skeleton project as a starting point, or use another framework of your choice. The only requirement is it must be Javascript based**

The goal of this exercise is to transform a set of vessel port calls into a sailing schedule and possible voyages for a user to select.

We have provided a json file which contains port calls (portCalls.json) for various vessels.  A port call contains the name of the vessel, a port and the dates the vessel arrives and departs from that port.  The port calls are grouped by a routeId.

While port calls are interesting what we really want is the ability to display the permutations of voyages that are possible within a date range.  For example, in our data set the 'USS Harpoon' starts a route from Hong Kong (HKHKG) and will travel to Oakland (USOAK), visiting Singapore and Los Angeles along the way.  If we were to display the possible voyages it would be as follows:

HKHKG to SGSIN  
HKHKG to USLAX  
HKHKG to USOAK  
SGSIN to USLAX  
SGSIN to USOAK  
USLAX to USOAK  

After completing this exercise a user should be able to enter a start and end date and get a list of voyages.  As mentioned you are free to use the provided skeleton app or write your own.

> Do not hesitate to ask questions about how this could/should be set up! This is not a strict quiz, it is a starting point for collaboration.

#### Skeleton Overview
The skeleton provided here is a barebones [Strongloop/Loopback](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Getting+started+with+LoopBack) application. The additions include

- A Port Call model which represents the port calls
- Pre-populating the sample data within
- An Angular client that includes two date pickers and a 'find' button.  The Angluar app can communicate with the loopback API / PortCall model to call the 'getRoutes' remote method / endpoint
- The 'getRoutes' endpoint is stubbed to only return the list of Port Calls between the date range

## Getting Started
- The [Create a Simple API](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Create+a+simple+API) tutorial for Strongloop is a great starting point, along with [Installing Strongloop](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Installing+StrongLoop) and [Loopback Core Concepts](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/LoopBack+core+concepts).
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) on your dev machine, and make sure [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is also installed (it should come with most distributions of node).
- Clone this repository.
- Once cloned, install the application dependencies using `npm install` in the root of the project.
- Once installed, start the application with `npm start` - this will regenerate the loopback Angular SDK and start the server.
- Extend the stubbed remote methods inside [common/models/portCalls.js](https://github.com/HavenInc/bacchus/blob/master/common/models/portCall.js) to return the expected voyages.
- Update and refactor the UI to match the provided mockup as closely as possible
- You can use the [API Explorer http://0.0.0.0:3000/explorer](http://0.0.0.0:3000/explorer) to test your new methods while in development.
- Document tradeoffs/shortcuts in the interest of time; this exercise should not take more than 2-3 hours for basic functionality.


## Bonus Options
- Add appropriate unit tests
- Create an npm run script inside package.json that uses supervisor to reload/rerun the code as you edit it.
- What would be an interesting way to present the app to the engineering team?
